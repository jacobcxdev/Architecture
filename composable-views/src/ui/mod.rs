//! A minimal, _but viable_, user interface layer.
//!
//! # Minimal
//!
//! **Minimal** exist as a separate feature so that applications that need
//! completely custom user interface elements are not weighted down by the
//! implementations here; while still having access to those same interface
//! elements to use as reference when building their own.
//!
//! - **Configurable**  
//!   Much of the design of Minimal’s user interface elements has been
//!   configured via `dependencies` as default values. As such they can be
//!   overridden by the applications as needed.
//! - **Incremental**  
//!   Furthermore, use of Minimal does not need to be all or nothing.
//!   Development of an application can begin with Minimal’s default
//!   look-and-feel and custom `View` implementations can be added
//!   incrementally to the application as its configurability becomes
//!   insufficient.
