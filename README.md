# A Composable Architecture

The Swift Composable Architecture library improves upon previous Redux-inspired patterns by leveraging the capabilities of the Swift language to achieve better **Type Safety**, **Ergonomics** and **Performance**.

This crate attempts to do the same to the Swift Composable Architecture itself by further leveraging the capabilities of the Rust language and ecosystem.

<summary><strong>What is the Swift Composable Architecture?</strong></summary>
<blockquote>
<p>The <a href='https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture'>Composable Architecture</a> (TCA, for short) is a library for building applications in a consistent and understandable way, with composition, testing, and ergonomics in mind. It can be used in SwiftUI, UIKit, and more, and on any Apple platform (iOS, macOS, tvOS, and watchOS).</p>
<h2>Learn More</h2>
<p>The Composable Architecture was designed over the course of many episodes on <a href='https://www.pointfree.co/'>Point•Free</a>, a video series exploring functional programming and the Swift language, hosted by Brandon Williams and Stephen Celis.</p>
<p>You can watch all of the episodes <a href='https://www.pointfree.co/collections/composable-architecture'>here</a>, as well as a dedicated, multipart tour of the architecture from scratch: <a href='https://www.pointfree.co/collections/composable-architecture/a-tour-of-the-composable-architecture/ep100-a-tour-of-the-composable-architecture-part-1'>part 1</a>, <a href='https://www.pointfree.co/collections/composable-architecture/a-tour-of-the-composable-architecture/ep101-a-tour-of-the-composable-architecture-part-2'>part 2</a>, <a href='https://www.pointfree.co/collections/composable-architecture/a-tour-of-the-composable-architecture/ep102-a-tour-of-the-composable-architecture-part-3'>part 3</a> and <a href='https://www.pointfree.co/collections/composable-architecture/a-tour-of-the-composable-architecture/ep103-a-tour-of-the-composable-architecture-part-4'>part 4</a>.</p>

The API has diverged to better reflect the different strengths (and weaknesses) of Rust and Swift, but the [core ideals](https://pointfreeco.github.io/swift-composable-architecture/main/documentation/composablearchitecture/) are the same.

- **State management**

  Using `State`s and `Reducer`s to manage Rust’s restrictions on [Variables and Mutability](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-01-variables-and-mutability.html#variables-and-mutability)…

- **Composition**
- **Side effects**
- **Testing**
- **Ergonomics**

# Why use Composable?

A composable architecture is based around…

> ### Note
>
> If you have already used another unidirectional data flow architecture for application state management, the main take-away is that the State-Reducer pattern is a great fit to Rust’s restrictions on [Variables and Mutability](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch03-01-variables-and-mutability.html#variables-and-mutability):
>
> - Rust requires mutable references to be unique
> - State mutations may only happen within a Reducer



As for *this crate* specifically. Features include:

- **Small**

  The core functionality is under 2000 lines of code and has minimal dependancies.[^wc]

- **Fast**

  `Store::send` takes less than 20 nanoseconds.  
  `Effects::action`s are 5–10× faster.

- **Reliable**

  No unsafe code. 



Furthermore, the optional `async` handling is done without dependence on a runtime. A `Store` runs its `Reducer` entirely within a single thread. At the same time, `Effects` make it easy for an application to run code, concurrently or in parallel, that feeds its results back into the appropriate `Reducer`.



## Usage

To use Composable, place the following line under the `[dependencies]` section in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
composable = { version = "0.6", git = "https://github.com/bwoods/Architecture.git" }
```



### Optional Features
****
- `unstable`: enable features that are still heavily under development. Unreleased features include:
  
  - `views`: immediate-mode user interface elements.  
    See [the module level documentation](https://bwoods.github.io/Architecture/composable/views/index.html) for more.
  
  Note that changes to `unstable` code will **never** be considered a semver breaking change.



[^wc]: As counted with `tokei --exclude src/views/ --exclude examples --exclude benches`.
